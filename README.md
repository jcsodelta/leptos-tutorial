# Testing Leptos

The subprojects in this repository follow the chapters of the Leptos Book, with several modifications.

https://book.leptos.dev/

I tried to restrict the implementations in each chapter to use only the features presented until that chapter.


# Requirements

To run the project we need:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)

# Running

Enter chapter directory and run ```trunk serve```

```bash
cd leptos-3_3
trunk serve
```
Then open the browser at the url http://127.0.0.1:8080/
